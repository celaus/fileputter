#summary The functional and non-functional requirements

= Introduction =

As many projects fileputter is was also created as an answer to a problem. This problem was that every time I wanted to "just share something" e.g. a document, I was not able to do this in a quick and easy way. While in Windows a shared folder is required ... and sometimes also a considerable amout of configuration. 

When trying to use instant messengers (like [http://www.pidgin.im Pidgin]) - file transfers hardly ever work (especially cross-platform ...). 

Being a developer my solution was to write a Java program that enables me to do that - without any configuration. I put togehter some requirements:

= Requirements =


== Functional Requirements ==
=== The program must be able to: ===
 # send a file (binary or text) over a network based on IPv4 adresses
 # receive a file (binary or text) from a network based on IPv4 adresses 
 # detect and add fellow computers automatically within the local network to a list
 # block adding or being added by other computers
 # add other computers by their DNS name or IPv4 adress from user input
 # feature a Graphical User Interface showing the list with the computers name and ip adress
 # let every user choose an individual name

=== The program should be able to: ===
 # maintain the list automatically (add or remove computers based on their availability)
 # send folders containing files and subfolders over a network based on IPv4 adresses
 # remain fully functional without a Graphical User Interface
 # support sending a file via dragging and dropping files and folders on the GUI
 # perform a integrity check after transfer




== Non-Functional Requirements ==

=== The program must: ===
 # enable the user to send the files and folders with three clicks (when the path is given)
 # be developed as an open source project
 # be able to perform with zero configuration

This list is yet to be completed!
